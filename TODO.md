# To do

Include a simple sample library. (The README implies there is one but there is not.)

Simplify the templates. Remove custom fonts.

Properly document the context used for templates.

The custom render-with-template function can probably be removed.

The lineform directrories are probably not required.

Replace use of email library with Strictyaml or some other simpler format? JSON?
